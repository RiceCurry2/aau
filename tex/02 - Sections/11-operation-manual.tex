\chapter{Operation Manual}

This chapter will contain basic knowledge needed to function as a basic operator of the demining robot, before the operator can use the prototype basis for the demining robot it is important that the operator understand basic concepts regarding Linux and ROS, thus a list of steps has been reproduced to receive error codes, start, stop and obtain manual control of the operation.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Turn on the robot and operating PC and wait approximately 5 minutes.
    \item SSH into the robot controller
    \item Launch gmapping\_demo and frontier\_exploration with following command:\\
        \begin{lstlisting}[language=bash,numbers=none]
  >  rosrun hit_t.he_road_jack and_dont_you_come_back  
        \end{lstlisting}
    \item Define a suitable path for frontier\_exploration
    \item Launch the "demining" package trough SSH on turtlebot with following command:\\
        \begin{lstlisting}[language=bash,numbers=none]
  >  rosrun no_more no_more
        \end{lstlisting}
    \item Allow the turtlebot to run the code and simulate demining on the suitable approximately
    \item Let the turtlebot return to it's docking station for recharge, every time the battery reaches 30\%
    \item Throughout the process, pay attention to the terminal for error messages
\end{enumerate}
