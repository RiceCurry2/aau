\section{12V 5A MOLEX Pin}

\hspace{3.5mm} $I = \dfrac{P}{U}$

\vspace{2mm}

$\Updownarrow P = U \cdot I$

\vspace{4mm}

We have a 12V MOLEX pin which can deliver 5A

\vspace{2mm}

$\mathbf{12V \cdot 5A = 60W}$

\vspace{2mm}

This means that we have 60W in total, on that MOLEX pin

\vspace{2mm}

\paragraph{Raspberry PI} - Consumes 5V 3A

\vspace{2mm}

$\mathbf{5V \cdot 3A = 15W}$

\vspace{2mm}

This means that the Raspberry PI consumes 15W at peak.

\vspace{2mm}

$\mathbf{60W - 15W = 45W}$

\vspace{4mm}

Leaving 45W left on the MOLEX pin which is equal to

\vspace{2mm}

$\mathbf{\dfrac{45W}{12V} = 3.75A}$

\section{19V 2A MOLEX Pin}

$I = \dfrac{P}{U}$, $P = U \cdot I$

\vspace{4mm}

We have a 19V MOLEX pin which can deliver 2A

\vspace{2mm}

$\mathbf{19V \cdot 2A = 38W}$
