\chapter{Final Problem Statement}

Throughout the problem analysis, it has become clear to the problem group that mines pose a large threat in all of the world, a focus country of the report became Afghanistan due to their high amount of casualties. Afghanistan is not an easy country logistically, meaning that the robot should have a main focus on its locomotion to gain an advantage over to current \gls{sota} demining robots.

Furthermore, the problem analysis shows that it is not only one type of mine which are found in the country of Afghanistan, as seen in section \ref{mas_23} the various images displayed to the right actually resides from Afghanistan and at least 52 different mine types have been demined in Afghanistan to this day \cite{cat-uxo}

\textbf{With the regard to current \gls{sota} demining robots, how-to, with a new demining robot product, make improvements on the \gls{sota} areas regarding the speed and proficiency in locating, and mapping, mines in heavily contaminated areas in Afghanistan.}
