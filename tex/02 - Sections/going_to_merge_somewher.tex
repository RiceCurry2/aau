When discussing robot locomotion, it is important to analyse the threats that the physical geography might pose to the logistic tasks that the robot has to do, with a slight focus on the country with the highest amount of casualties due to landmines, more specifically Afghanistan figure \ref{fig:af_elev} shows  %that there is a shifting terrain but mainly it is mountainous and rugged.
