\section{Final Problem Statement}

With the regard to current \gls{sota} demining robots, how to, with a new demining robot product, make improvements on the \gls{sota} areas regarding the speed and proficiency in locating, and mapping, mines in heavily contaminated areas in Afghanistan.

\section{Delimitation}

Due to time constrain, designing a new demining robot product that could satisfy the needed requirements in the final statement, i.e. increased speed in localisation and mapping, maneuverability on any surface other than on an indoor flat surface, we made a delimited problem statement.

\section{A Delimited Problem Statement}\label{delimit_statement}

How we get the Turtlebot 2e to act as proof of concept for the part of our final problem statement which addresses the need for an algorithm to make a robot map an area while in the process of locating objects which have the same attributes as various landmines
